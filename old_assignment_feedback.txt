Implementation: Source Code is accessible and reviewed. 

NN comparison with algorithms: 
    Missing Importance of Optimization Problems was not explained. 
    Problem description could be improved with discussions on how are the global and local optima 
    situated, are they smooth and differentiable etc., 

Problem 1: Continuous peaks used to highlight GA.
    Performance against iterations is missing. 
    Also problem size and function evaluations versus Fitness was not analyzed. 
    The report could benefit from deeper insights from the author around how the other algorithms 
    function in contrast to GA for this problem. The intent of the report is to understand 
    optimization algorithms and drawing intuition around algorithmic behaviour and its suitability 
    for problem spaces. Convergence analysis could be improved on identifying stopping conditions 
    and exploration on generality versus specificity of GA on this problem. 

Problem 2: Flipflops used to highlight SA. 
    Performance against iterations is missing. 
    Also problem size and function evaluations versus Fitness was not analyzed. 
    Convergence analysis could be improved on identifying stopping conditions and exploration on 
    generality versus specificity of SA on this problem. Some hyper parameter exploration was 
    done and few good insights. But needs further indepth analysis to understand why SA performed 
    better in comparison to other algorithms and contrast with previous problems and observations. 

MISSING: 
    Usually Max K Color or Four peaks works optimal for MIMIC. Or you could also highlight 
    negative traits of MIMIC. There is no necessity that it should only be in positive light. 
    
Conclusion: Missing. 

Good effort with the sections analyzed and could be improved further. Good luck with the rest of 
the semester!
